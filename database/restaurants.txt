However this place kept drawing my attention because of its stylish African inspired interior and shelves with special food products.\n\nWe decided to go for dinner and enjoyed a vegan senegalese mafe and a vegan durban salad plus a home made ginger drink. All the food served is from different locations in Africa, but they don’t do typical North African, Moroccan food who are already well established world wide with their tagine dishes.\n\nThe mafe was delicious and the salad too, it’s interesting to discover this kind of food because African restos are more scarce than many other world kitchens in general. \n\nFor dessert I had a slice with gluten free sponge cake with raspberries and pistachios, it was baked with cassava flour and tasted very fresh. A perfect ending with the aromatic Ethiopian coffee. \n\nThe service and interior are impeccable, if you’re curious about African food this is a good place to start.

Not surprisingly, there are many foreigners, but on the day we were there, there were definitely some French voices as well. \n\nThe details of the menu and service are described in numerous other posts, so I’ll just comment on the food. On the day we were there, we found most of the dishes to be quite rich. This is not to say that the flavors were bad or the execution poor, but the foie gras, cream and butter eventually took their toll and three of the four of us were feeling very full by the time the main course came around. \n\nWe don’t mind rich food on occasion, and it’s quife possible that the richness varies in accordance with the raw ingredients.

The appetizer was a stunning langoustine in a Granny Smith curried apple sauce and foam. Simply delicious and perfectly cooked (i.e. not overcooked). The main course was a marinated quail in wine reduction with chestnuts, mushrooms and delightful little vegetables. The portion was generous but still sensible. The wine pairings were spot-on and reasonably priced.\n\nThe chef appears to work alone in the tiny kitchen. While the restaurant is quite small (maybe 30 seats) it was full, and the dishes came out at a very reasonable pace. There were two male waitstaff who were informative, friendly, professional and explained things in French or English depending of the guest’s preference.\n\nGiven that the chef appears to work solo (though he may have prepping help I did not see) the fixed menu is probably his only option. This was certainly no problem for me the day I was there - I loved all the choices. That may not be true every day for everyone, so calling beforehand to hear what’s on the menu might be advisable. I had no choice, given a short stay in Paris, and don’t mind surprises anyway.

            "content": "Unacceptable standard for a Japanese restaurant\nWas over in Paris this week for my Europe tour and decided to check out Guilo Guilo after seeing all the largely positive reviews online. It was a cosy little place and it was nice to be greeted by a friendly mix of French & Japanese crew. English speaking crew are always a plus here in Paris.\n\nThey serve a secret Chef's menu or most call it the Omakase set that cost €55, which is incredibly overpriced if you'd ask me, but allow me get to that. First dish that came was a tiny glutinous rice dish that had Roasted Eel (Unagi) on it. I literally choked on it as the fine bones were stuck at the back of my throat. It's not my first time having Unagi, having eaten across the region and several times in some of Japan's finest establishments.\n\nUnagi bones are usually soft and edible, but this one I had was really tough and it got stuck and caused much pain and discomfort to me. When I informed the crew and chef, all they did was to get some sushi rice to get me to swallow, in the hole that it would help force the bone down my throat. I appreciate that gesture, I really do. And the crew apologised that the Unagi was all frozen during this season of time and they probably didn't do a thorough check on it.\n\nSo let's be very clear here. It is absolutely unacceptable for a Japanese restaurant or chef to present a dish that is of this standard to any guest. Known for their highest standards in culinary, you wouldn't expect anything like this. I was actually quite mad how the Japanese Chef just brushed the issue off very easily. It's not a small issue. That is not the Japanese way, so please do not tell me this is the norm. It's NOT. What a shame, and we only just started the evening with the bone stuck in my throat. Just horrible.\n\nAnd as much as I'd like to be objective, some of the other dishes throughout the night was okay and some below average. It was really mediocre. It seem as though the chef tried to be adventurous in his creations just for the sake of being adventurous. \n\nOverall, I wanna sum up this restaurant isn't awful when it comes to the taste department. But for the amount of money I dished out, I was expecting a lot more. Top up a little to the €55 and you could easily get a great experience at a Michelin Starred meal in Tokyo. \n\nI won't recommend anyone who's well travelled or foodie to come here that's for sure. You can't be great when the fundamentals are not done right. Much to learn from the real Japanese Takumi craftsmanship of food making.\n\nBest,\nEric",
